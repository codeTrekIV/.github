## Hi there 👋

Let's build some great looking and interesting coding projects or portfolio. Or just play around with stuff. I just want to figure stuff out. Blog about it? Is that still a thing?

Anyways, welcome to the organization. Thank you for taking the time to look at my code and organization. It is intended to be a portfolio and playground to experiment and just use the skills I have and keep them sharp.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
